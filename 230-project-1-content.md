Project 1: Proposal
===
Game Concept
---

A maze-like puzzle game where you must avoid obstacles as you move through. The catch? You don’t actually 
move until you release the key leaving you blindly guessing how far you’ll go.

Genre
---

Slider is a maze/puzzle game in which you have to navigate a maze without running into any obstacles.

Platform
---

Slider will be a desktop only game. There exists the possibility of making it mobile friendly as well however 
that is not the initial target.

Story
---

There is not story in Slider. Its abstract style and simple premise leaves it only giving the player the 
goal of making it to the end of the level.

Aesthetics
---

The style of Slider will be very abstract (and only partially because I lack any artistic skill). The character 
and obstacles will consist of simply colored uniform shapes and the walls of the level will be very plain as well.

Gameplay
---

The player must navigate their way through a maze without running into any obstacles. However, they cannot 
see how far they are moving until the key is released meaning they will have to estimate where they’ll end 
up. They player must reach the end before they use up all their lives.

About the Developer

My name is Alex Herman and I'm a second year Game Design and Development student at RIT. My skills in coding are 
mostly in C# and Java. I'm also proficient in several programs such as Photoshop, Maya, and Unity. My interests 
are all over the place from languages, to science, to history and everywhere in between. Games happen to be a decent 
way for me to combine all, or at least most, of my interests.
